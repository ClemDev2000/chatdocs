ChatDocs is an open source project that provides a way to perform Q&A on your online documentation in real-time.

## Prerequisites ü•á

This project uses:

- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) and [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) for hosting the Google Cloud Function backend.
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) for generating answers.
- [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) for indexing the documentation.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting the web application.

Be sure to have an account and your credentials for each of these services.

> Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) installed on your machine.

## Architecture üèõÔ∏è

The project is composed of the following components:

- `webapp`: folder containing the frontend code for the Q&A website.
- `crawl.py`: Python script to crawl a website and index its content in Pinecone.
- `main.py`: Entrypoint for the Google Cloud Function.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with ChatDocs, follow these instructions:

### Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ClemDev2000/chatdocs
```

### Install dependencies

It will create a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies.

```sh
./setup.sh
```

### Customize the project

1. Fill the `.env` file with your OpenAI and Pinecone credentials.
2. Edit the `webapp/public/logo.svg` with the logo of your service.

### Index your documentation

- `domain` is your top-level domain (e.g. `stripe.com`).
- `url` is the root URL of the page you want to index (e.g. `https://stripe.com/docs/atlas/`). In that case, the script will crawl all the pages with the following wildcard: `https://stripe.com/docs/atlas/*`.
- `excludes` (optional) is a list of URLs you want to exclude from the index. It can be useful if you want to exclude the homepage or the pricing page.

```sh
python3 crawl.py \
  --domain stripe.com \
  --url https://stripe.com/docs \
  --excludes https://stripe.com/docs/api,https://stripe.com/docs/js,https://stripe.com/docs/cli
```

### Running the project locally

Open a terminal and run:

```sh
functions-framework --target=chatdocs --debug
```

Your function is now running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Open another terminal and run:

```sh
cd webapp
npm run dev
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the website.

### Deploy the Google Cloud Function

Deploy the Google Cloud Function by running:

```sh
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)

gcloud alpha functions deploy chatdocs \
  --gen2 \
  --project=$PROJECT_ID \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --runtime=python310 \
  --source=. \
  --entry-point=chatdocs \
  --trigger-http \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --concurrency=5 \
  --memory=2Gib \
  --timeout=120s
```

### Deploy the web application on Vercel

- Go to your dashboard and create a new project.
- Select `Next.js` as the framework preset.
- Select `webapp` as the root directory.
- Add an environment variables named `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` with the URL of your Google Cloud Function [that you just deployed](https://console.cloud.google.com/functions/details/us-central1/chatdocs).
- Click on `Deploy` and wait for the deployment to finish.
